# Introduction

This study aims to utilize data analysis processes and techniques such as cleaning, 
transforming, exploration, manipulation, visualization to identify hidden useful information and 
relationship in the given dataset.

The given dataset is the three-year final math scores of degree students of two schools 
Gabriel Pereira (GP) and Mousinho da Silveira (MS). Besides the score, this dataset also 
contains many attributes such as family backgrounds and daily habits that might affect their final 
performance.

By analyzing the given information in the dataset, questions and analyses will be listed 
below followed by the findings and the conclusion. These conclusion and factors found can then 
be used to help students improve their final performances.
